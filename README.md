# Grainger GTG Final Presentation
## Web app made with Svelte, HTML, and CSS

I utilized what I learned during my Summer with Grainger to create a website for my final presentation, which was showcased at an event open to all GTG (Grainger Technology Group) members before the end of my internship.

## Summary of Presentation

### About Me
- I am a 5th year senior at Illinois Tech. I will be graduating this coming May with both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science.

- I am originally from New Orleans, but I moved to Chicago a few years ago and have absolutely loved every minute of my time here!

- When I am not working or studying, I enjoy cooking, traveling, biking around the city, or sitting by the river with a good book.
